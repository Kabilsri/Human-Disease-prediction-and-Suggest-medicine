### Human-Disease-prediction-and-Suggest-medicine


## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based disease prediction system that allows users to input symptoms and receive potential disease predictions along with suggested medications. It is built using Python and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.

## Features
- **Symptom-Based Prediction:** Users can select symptoms, and the model predicts possible diseases.
- **Medicine Suggestions:** Based on the predicted disease, the system suggests relevant medications.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** A simple interface built using Tkinter.
- **Data Processing & Visualization:** Uses Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data processing)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
